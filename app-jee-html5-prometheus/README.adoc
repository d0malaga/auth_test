[abstract]
Demonstrate how to configure Wildlfy Elytron with a keycloak Adapter for openid reusing app-jee-html5. Collecting application and wildfly metrics into Prometheus/Grafana.

== What is it?

Based on the wildfly/keycloak docs/quickstarts:

* https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#jboss-eap-wildfly-adapter
* https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/tree/latest/app-jee-html5
* https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/tree/latest/service-jee-jaxrs
* https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/tree/master/microprofile-metrics

Included components:

 * Wildfly > 11, tested on Wildfly 24
 * An installed keycloak adapter for Wildfly
 * A configured IdP server, see below
 * A configured Prometheus
 * Grafana with some sample dashboards (using the helm chart bitnami/grafana)

=== Using helm with included external charts

The Grafana build here reuses the bitnami/grafana helm chart without creating any own docker files. Most of the kubernetes files are defined in the helm chart, but it requires local definitions:

* Each dashboard has its own configmap. One crude dashboard included
* All data sources (in this case only Prometheus) are defined in a secret
* The helm chart needs values.yaml to point to the local definitions

k8s:helm didn't seem to be able to create a values.yaml with Grafana dashboards (I failed to use complex value objects, googling and reading jkube source code indicates this is not yet fully supported) so this build has some workarounds to copy in that file after running k8s:helm:

[source,subs="attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
...
$ mvn k8s:helm
# Added other maven plugins to this goal
$ mvn integration-test
# Need this to include the external bitnami chart into the grafana helm chart
$ helm dependency update grafana/target/jkube/helm/app-jee-html5-prometheus-grafana/kubernetes
# Examples with sub modules need to include them in the main chart 'charts' directory
$ helm dependency update target/jkube/helm/{artifactId}/kubernetes/
----


== Access the application

The application will be running at the following URLs:

 * Docker-compose http://<THIS_HOST>:8080/app-html5/
 * K8s: http://<THIS_HOST>:31180/app-html5/
 ** users: appadmin/abcd123, appuser/abcd123, guest/abcd123
 * The IdP runs on the port 8081/31281, user: admin, password admin
 * Prometheus collects data over k8s
 ** Prometheus, k8s: http://<THIS_HOST>:31290
 ** Wildfly admin port - 9990/metrics, exposed as a nodeport see kubectl

*Note*: With the IdP and the Wildfly running inside NAT:ed containers they cannot use localhost as the hostname. Both the IdP and Wildfly launch scripts takes environment variables like $IDP_HOST, $WEB_HOST. For openid to work they seems to have to be the same in all places, including the url you type in the browser to access the application.
