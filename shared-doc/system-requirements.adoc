The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

The quickstarts builds Docker images that can be be run by docker-compose or Kubernetes. Some help services runs in docker images so at least docker is neccesary to run these examples.
